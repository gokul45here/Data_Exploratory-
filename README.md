Exploratory Data Analysis using Python on Titanic dataset
# 🧠 Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Objective  
Perform EDA on the **Titanic dataset** using Python to discover patterns, trends, and relationships affecting passenger survival.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## ⚙️ Steps Followed  
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas  
2. Checked data types, missing values, and statistics  
3. Cleaned data (`Age`, `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin`)  
4. Plotted histograms, boxplots, countplots, and heatmaps  
5. Found correlations and insights

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Females and 1st-class passengers had higher survival rates  
- Most passengers were aged **20–40 years**  
- **Fare** is positively correlated with survival  
- **3rd-class** passengers had the lowest survival rate
